 * {@link AbstractGraph.postProcessCellStyle} (defined in `CellsMixin`) delegates bundle key resolution to this
 * plugin: when registered, a `style.image` that matches a bundle key is replaced with the underlying
 * URL/data URI; when this plugin is NOT registered (for instance on a {@link BaseGraph} without explicit
 * opt-in), the bundle lookup is silently skipped and the raw `style.image` key is used as the image path.
